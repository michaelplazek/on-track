BLOCK LOGIC
IF (block |+6| notOccupied) THEN (blocks |+6| auto)
IF (crossing |+6| isOccupied) THEN (crossing /19/ closed)
IF (crossing |-6| isOccupied) THEN (crossing /19/ closed)
SWITCH LOGIC
IF (pblock |0| ignore) AND (n1block |+8| notOccupied) AND (n2block |0| ignore) AND (preferred |0| switchN1) THEN (switch /57/ switchN1)
IF (pblock |0| ignore) AND (n1block |+8| notOccupied) AND (n2block |0| ignore) AND (preferred |0| switchN2) THEN (switch /57/ switchN2)
